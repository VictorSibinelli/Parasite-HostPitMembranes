# Repository Structure


## `data`
This directory holds all necessary data files for analysis, including `.csv` and `.txt` files with metadata. All primary measurements were acquired using ImageJ software.

### `raw`
this was used for data storage before typo correction and data wrangling

### `processed`
Contains `.csv` files with cleaned data after wrangling that was actually used for the analysis. Contains a subfolder for storing the ressampled data for the bootstrap analysis


## `scripts`
This directory includes scripts for running the analysis:

- **`00-library.R`**: Checks for required packages, installs missing ones, and manages package versions using `groundhog`.
- **`01-data_Preop.R`**: Handles data manipulation.
- **`02-Ressampling.R`**: Performs all the ressampling of the data.
- **`03_1-Model_Analysis.R`**: fits the statistical models with GLMM.
- **`03_2-Bootstrap_analysis.R`**: Performs the bootstrap analysis.
- **`03_3-PCA.R`**: Performs the PCA.
- **`03_4-indiv_test.R`**: Performs the individual level comparison analysis
- **`04_1-CI95.R`**: Generate the 95% confidence interval plot.
- **`04_2-Correlation.R`**: Performs the bivariate correlation analysis.
- **`04_3-Slope_graph.R`**: Generate the bivariate correlation plot.
- **`04_4-violin.R`**: generate the the violin plots.
- **`04_5-Waves.R`**: Generate the Tpm comparison with the cited literature models

## `outputs`
Contains results from the analysis and graphics scripts:

### `figs` 
Includes figures produced by the scripts.

  
### `tables`
Contains result tables generated by the scripts.


# Repository Usage
run the scripts in the order mentioned above
