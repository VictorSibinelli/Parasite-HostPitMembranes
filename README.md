# Overview

This repository contains all data, scripts, and outputs (including supplementary materials) for the paper "XXX" (currently in progress).

The data were collected from mature wood samples using light and electronic microscopy techniques. For detailed methodologies, refer to the Materials and Methods sections of the article available at [XXXXX](xxxxx).

# Repository Structure


## `data`
This directory holds all necessary data files for analysis, including `.csv` and `.txt` files with metadata. All primary measurements were acquired using ImageJ software.

### `raw`
Contains the original data files for analysis:
- **`2xWallThickness`**: Measurements of intervascular double wall thickness.
- **`VesselsDiameter`**: Data on individual vessel diameters.
- **`VesselCount`**: Vessel frequency and fraction data.
- **`Pits`**: Linear measurements of intervascular wall pits.
- **`PitsDiameter`**: Diameter measurements of intervascular pit chambers.
- **`PitsOpening`**: Diameter measurements of intervascular wall pit openings.
- **`PitsArea`**: Area measurements of intervascular wall pits.

### `processed`
Contains `.csv` files with cleaned data after wrangling, table manipulation, and outlier removal.


## `scripts`

This directory includes scripts for running the analysis:

- **`00-library.R`**: Checks for required packages, installs missing ones, and manages package versions using `groundhog`.
- **`01-data_Wrangling.R`**: Handles data manipulation.
- **`02-TestAssumptions.R`**: Performs statistical tests for assumptions (divided by dataset).
- **`03-DataAnalysis.R`**: Generates figures presented in the article (divided by dataset).
- **`04-Graphics.R`**: Creates figures for the article (divided by dataset).

## `outputs`
Contains results from the analysis and graphics scripts:

### `figs` 
Includes figures produced by the scripts.

- **`Assumptions`**: Kernel density plots and box plots for normality and homogeneity of variance checks.
- **`Plots`**:Graphs present in the final manuscript
  
### `tables`
Contains result tables generated by the scripts.
